#  Introduction: Machine Learning Projects

This repository serves as a hub for my ongoing Machine Learning endeavors. As I continue to explore and develop new projects, this space will be updated with the latest advancements, experiments, and insights gained in the field of ML.

# Projects

Here are some of the projects included in this repository:

Project 1: House Price Prediction 

https://github.com/Jimeng-Long/ML-Projects/blob/main/HousePricePredict.ipynb

The project is to implement machine learning algorithms using Scikit-Learn to predict Median house prices for California districts.

Project 2: Image Classification

https://github.com/Jimeng-Long/ML-Projects/blob/main/ImageClassification.ipynb

This project is to implement computer vision algorithms (ANN and CNN) using Tensorflow to classify images into correct categories.

Data source: CIFAR-10 dataset (Canadian Institute For Advanced Research).
